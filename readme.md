# UI Experiments

A personal collection of UI components and animation experiments.

This repository is a **playground**,  
I use it to quickly build, test, and explore interaction ideas—often inspired by designs I come across online.

---

## What this repo is
- Small UI & animation experiments
- Components built for learning and exploration
- A place to prototype ideas quickly without overthinking structure or polish

If you’re looking for a drop-in library, this isn’t it.

---

## Tech Stack
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript
- Motion
- GSAP

---

## Credits & Inspiration

Some components are inspired by designs found on platforms like Dribbble, Pinterest, Twitter, or other public sources.

- **Design credit always belongs to the original creator**

If you are the original designer and want:
- proper credit added, or
- a component removed  

please open an issue or DM me directly

## Usage

You’re free to:
- explore the code
- learn from it
- adapt parts for personal projects

## Notes
This repo will evolve organically.  
Some components may be rough, some may be refined—that’s intentional.
